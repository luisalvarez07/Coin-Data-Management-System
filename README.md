# Coin Data Management System Design Document

## Overview

The Coin Data Management System aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing U.S. coin data. This document outlines the design considerations, architectural decisions, and user interface concepts for the system.

## Architecture

### Data Structure
The system utilizes a list-based data structure to store coin data. Each coin is represented as a dictionary, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of coin attributes.

### Search Algorithms
Two search algorithms are implemented:
- **Filter Coins by Denomination**: Filters coins based on the specified denomination.
- **Filter Coins by Condition**: Filters coins based on the specified condition.

### Sorting Mechanisms
Two sorting mechanisms are implemented:
- **Sort Coins by Value**: Sorts coins based on their monetary value.
- **Sort Coins by Year**: Sorts coins based on their year of minting.

## User Interface Design

### Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of the coin collection and access to various functionalities.
- **Search Bar**: Enables users to search for coins by denomination or condition.
- **Sort Options**: Allows users to sort the coin collection based on different attributes.
- **Data Display**: Presents coin data in a clear and organized manner, facilitating easy navigation.

### Interaction Flow
- Users interact with the system through intuitive graphical elements.
- Upon launching the application, users are greeted with the dashboard.
- They can perform searches, sort the collection, and view detailed information about individual coins.

## Data Persistence

### Storage Format
Coin data is stored persistently in a JSON file. This format allows for easy serialization and deserialization of data, ensuring data integrity and compatibility across platforms.

### Data Management
- **Insert Coin**: Adds new coin data to the collection stored in the JSON file.
- **Delete Coin**: Removes specified coin data from the collection stored in the JSON file.

## Error Handling

### Exception Handling
Basic error handling is implemented using 'try-except' blocks:
- **JSONDecodeError**: Handled when reading the JSON file, initializing the list of coins if the file is empty.

## Future Enhancements

### User Authentication
Implement user authentication to secure access to sensitive coin data.

### Enhanced Visualization
Introduce graphical representations of coin statistics for improved data analysis.
